This code solves 2D potential flow and transport problems over
triangular grids.

This code was originally written my Mats Nigam (in FORTRAN) as part of
his PhD thesis on suspension flows at MIT. Arthur Moncorge
(arthur.moncorge@ensta.org) made enhancements including converting the
code to C++ as part of a master project at the University of
Cambridge. Jason Furtney made some modifications to the software
including the configuration file parser.

Mats and Arthur released this code under the GNU General Public
License.

The development of a Python wrapper for this code is underway.
